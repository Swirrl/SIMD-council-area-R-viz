# SIMD-council-area-R-viz
This repo shows an example of visualising Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) on an interactive map using R. 
The [```leaflet```](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package was used to show the mean SIMD rank for each council area in Scotland with the aim of visually representing the relative level of deprivation across the different council areas.
